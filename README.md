# medical-insurance-predict
A regression model to predict the medical insurance charges for a patient

Description : Predict the cost of medical insurance based on features like age, no. of children, smoker or not, gender.
Machine learning tasks are done to achieve the same. Since the cost charges to predict are continuous values, we have performed regression task.

REQUIREMENTS
1. scikit learn - to perform machine learning tasks and evaluate performances.
Install using the following command

```pip install sklearn``` 

2. gradio - to create the user interface.
Install using the following command

```pip install gradio```

3. matplotlib & seaborn -  for data visulaisation and comparisons.
Install using the following command

```pip install seaborn```

### HOW TO RUN 
-> Clone the GitHub repo to local system
-> Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter notebook or upload in Google Drive and open in Colaboratory.
-> Run the cells to view the results.

### REFERENCES
1. Kaggle - 'insurance.csv' was downloaded from Kaggle. 
Referenced data visualization from Kaggle.
2. Gradio Docs - To implement the interface for the ML model.

**Further improvements are in progress to get a better performance metric and improve the prediction score**
